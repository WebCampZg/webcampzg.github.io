<h2>About this document<a class="headerlink" href="#about-this-document" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This document provides the overview of the talks selection process, and provides
some advice for rating talk submissions. The document is informal in its nature,
so treat it more as a set of guidelines, rather than a bunch of must-follow
rules. The talks committee is a small team, and it’s assumed that committee
members are all sensible people who can reach a consensus without needing a
large set of bureaucratic rules.</p>
<p>Input from committee members is highly encouraged. If you find anything you
disagree with, or you think some additional points are worth including, feel
free to submit your proposals.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="goals">
<h2>Goals<a class="headerlink" href="#goals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As the talks committee, our task is to select the talks for the conference
program. We want the conference attendees to have the great experience, and walk
away from the conference with good impressions, and many new insights. To make
that happen, we aim to reach the following goals:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Create an interesting program which will educate and inspire people.</li>
<li>Provide a balanced selection of topics for designers, frontend, and backend
developers.</li>
<li>Have a diverse lineup of speakers of different genders, nations, and
experience levels.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="selection-process">
<h2>Selection process<a class="headerlink" href="#selection-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the first part of the process each member of the committee rates the
submissions. Preferably, this rating is done in isolation, without discussing
submissions with other members. Then, about a week after the CFP is closed, the
committee and the members of the core team will meet, and select the final
lineup.</p>
<p>During the meeting, we’ll first compare individual ratings, and discuss the
submissions with large rating deviations. In this phase, each member will be
given the opportunity to change their rating.</p>
<p>Then, we’ll pick the conference program taking into account the following
factors:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>average rating by committee members</li>
<li>balance of topics</li>
<li>diversity of speakers</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, the final lineup will not be based exclusively on ratings, but
also on the points mentioned in the “Goals” section. So, for example, if two
talks about the same topic have a high average rating, we might select just one
of them. Likewise, we might drop some better rated talks in one area (e.g.
design) to reach a better balance. Those decisions will be reached by consensus
of all the participants.</p>
<p>The members of the core team will have an advisory role in the meeting. They
will also have the power to veto certain decisions, and break the tie in
situations where the committee members can’t reach the consensus.</p>
<p>The final output of the meeting will be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the list of selected short and long talks</li>
<li>the list of talks which will enter the community vote</li>
<li>the list of backup talks</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rating">
<h2>Rating<a class="headerlink" href="#rating" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each talk is rated with a 1-5 grade. A rough meaning of grades is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>5 - Excellent talk which must be included</li>
<li>4 - Very good talk, would make a great addition to the lineup</li>
<li>3 - A good talk, would like to see it included</li>
<li>2 - Not a great talk, but can be included if there are no better options</li>
<li>1 - I don’t think that this talk is appropriate for webcamp (VETO)</li>
</ul>
<p>As a committee member, you’re expected to rate most of the submissions. However,
you can decide to skip some submissions in some cases, such as:</p>
<p>You don’t feel qualified to grade the talk (e.g. a backend developer might skip
rating designer submissions, and vice versa).</p>
<p>You feel that there’s some conflict of interest regarding a particular
submission.</p>
<p>All submissions should be rated on their own merit. For example, if there are
many submissions on the same subject, the committee member shouldn’t decrease
the grade of some of them in fear that multiple talks with the same subject will
be accepted. Likewise, if the same speaker has multiple submissions, don’t try
to promote one submission by degrading all others.</p>
<p>As explained in the “Selection process” section, we’ll address these concerns in
the final meeting.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tips">
<h2>Tips<a class="headerlink" href="#tips" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section contains some tips you can consider during the rating process.
These are not rules which are meant to be followed strictly. You’re of course
advised to use your own judgement. Ultimately, the goal of the rating process is
to help us choose a great conference program, not to follow some set of
bureaucratic rules.</p>
<div class="section" id="submission">
<h3>Submission<a class="headerlink" href="#submission" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Prefer submissions which are clearly formulated and explained. If a speaker can
properly summarize the topic into a brief text, it’s a good indication that they
can also produce an informative talk.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="topic">
<h3>Topic<a class="headerlink" href="#topic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Prefer topics which are interesting to a wider audience. This include
introductory talks, use-case demonstrations, general purpose topics about IT.
The niche talks, such as “Performance tips when using library Foo with the
language Bar” will likely not be interesting nor relevant to a wider group of
people.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="speaker">
<h3>Speaker<a class="headerlink" href="#speaker" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Consider speaker’s biography, public profile (e.g. social networks, YouTube,
GitHub, joind.in), and the ratings of their past talks (if they spoke on
WebCamp). If a video is available, take a brief look to verify if the speaker
presentation style and clarity.</p>
<p>However, try to avoid negative discrimination. If a speaker doesn’t have a high
public profile, they shouldn’t be punished for that. We also shouldn’t
discriminate first time speakers.</p>
<p>To summarize, if there are some positive traits about the speaker’s biography or
their public profile, you may consider increasing the grade. On the other hand,
a lack of public profile or past talking experience shouldn’t be punished by
lowering the grade.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="objective-rating">
<h3>Objective rating<a class="headerlink" href="#objective-rating" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Don’t let your personal feelings about the topic affect your rating. For
example, if the talk is about a programming language which you personally
dislike, but the language is widely used and interesting, you shouldn’t give the
submission a lower grade. Likewise, don’t give a higher grade just because the
discussed technology is something you’re personally passionate about. It goes
without saying that you should avoid promoting submissions by friends and
family. If you feel that the conflict of interest is too strong, you can always
skip rating the submission.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="duration">
<h3>Duration<a class="headerlink" href="#duration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Be mindful of the proposed talk duration, particularly for 45 minutes slots.
Some topics work better as short ones, while others work better as long ones.
Some candidates may submit the same submission for both 25 and 45 minute slot,
and it’s perfectly fine if your grade is different between the two submissions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dashboard">
<h3>Dashboard<a class="headerlink" href="#dashboard" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The grading dashboard offers the option of commenting talks. Links can be added
as well as text, and videos will be expanded on the submission page. When
reviewing an application, you’re encouraged to add links of other talks of the
applicant to save others the effort. However, don’t include opinionated
comments, to avoid influencing the opinion of others.</p>
